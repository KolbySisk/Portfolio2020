I challenged myself to create a tool that could be used to help people\n              struggling with student loan debt. The solution I came up with is a platform where\n              users could receive donations that would be sent directly to their loan provider.\n              Donators can choose to donate - once or monthly - to a random user, or explore the\n              community and donate to a specific user.\n            </p>\n          </ElementSpacing>\n\n          <a href=\"https://eraise.loans\" style={{ display: 'inline-block' }} target=\"_blank\">\n            <FaLink style={{ fontSize: 12 }} /> View live project\n          </a>\n        </Animator>\n        <Animator containerType={ContainerType.ImageSquare}>\n          <picture>\n            <source\n              srcSet={require(`../../public/images/work/eraise/about.png?webp`)}\n              type=\"image/webp\"\n            />\n            <img src={require(`../../public/images/work/eraise/about.png`)} />\n          </picture>\n        </Animator>\n      </DoubleColumn>\n      <Animator containerType={ContainerType.CenterBanner} backgroundColor={Color.silver}>\n        <FontColor color={Color.darkGray}>\n          <ElementSpacing>\n            <TextCenter>\n              <h2>Challenge</h2>\n            </TextCenter>\n          </ElementSpacing>\n          <p>\n            Design and build an automated, secure, optimized, and scalable app along with the\n            supporting company infrastructure.

While brainstorming the logo I\n            wanted to create an emphasis on compassion and hope. I came up with a heart shaped\n            balloon meant to symbolize the hope to raise yourself out of debt with the help of a\n            loving community. For the colors I wanted them to be friendly but at the same time show\n            professionalism to help users feel secure when making donations or importing their loan\n            information.\n          </p>\n        </Animator>\n        <Animator containerType={ContainerType.ImageSquare}>\n          <picture>\n            <source\n              srcSet={require(`../../public/images/work/eraise/branding.png?webp`)}\n              type=\"image/webp\"\n            />\n            <img src={require(`../../public/images/work/eraise/branding.png`)} />\n          </picture>\n        </Animator>\n      </DoubleColumn>\n\n      <DoubleColumn reverse={true}>\n        <Animator containerType={ContainerType.ContentSquare} backgroundColor={Color.silver}>\n          <FontColor color={Color.darkGray}>\n            <ElementSpacing>\n              <h2>Wireframes</h2>\n            </ElementSpacing>\n            <p>\n              Since one of my goals was to finish this project quickly, I had to make agile\n              decisions. The wireframing process is a great example. Instead of using a prototyping\n              tool like I normally would when working with a team, I decided to stick with only pen\n              and paper then move directly into the design process. This meant I was doing a lot of\n              touch up and iterations in design phase, but overall it helped me get the designs done\n              quicker so I could move onto the development.\n            </p>\n          </FontColor>\n        </Animator>\n        <Animator containerType={ContainerType.ImageSquare}>\n          <picture>\n            <source\n              srcSet={require(`../../public/images/work/eraise/wireframes.png?webp`)}\n              type=\"image/webp\"\n            />\n            <img src={require(`../../public/images/work/eraise/wireframes.png`)} />\n          </picture>\n        </Animator>\n      </DoubleColumn>\n\n      <DoubleColumn>\n        <Animator containerType={ContainerType.ContentSquare} backgroundColor={work.color}>\n          <ElementSpacing>\n            <h2>Design Iterations</h2>\n          </ElementSpacing>\n          <p>\n            I loved seeing the improvements after each design iteration. The Sketch file slowly\n            turned into a showcase of the importance of iterating when designing. This project was\n            also my first major project using Sketch so I was able to learn a lot about modern UI\n            design processes.\n          </p>\n        </Animator>\n        <Animator containerType={ContainerType.ImageSquare}>\n          <picture>\n            <source\n              srcSet={require(`../../public/images/work/eraise/iterations.png?webp`)}\n              type=\"image/webp\"\n            />\n            <img src={require(`../../public/images/work/eraise/iterations.png`)} />\n          </picture>\n        </Animator>\n      </DoubleColumn>\n\n      <DoubleColumn reverse={true}>\n        <Animator containerType={ContainerType.ContentSquare} backgroundColor={Color.silver}>\n          <FontColor color={Color.darkGray}>\n            <ElementSpacing>\n              <h2>Finished Designs</h2>\n            </ElementSpacing>\n            <p>\n              Ultimately I created a design that I really liked. I was able to create a design\n              language that would be used when designing new pages. The design language helped\n              streamline the design process and ensure consistency. The goals of the design were to\n              make it easy & quick to donate, and sign up. I also wanted to put an importance on\n              learning exactly what the platform does, what information it collects, and ensure\n              users felt secure. Lastly, I wanted to create a unique and fun experience when using\n              the app.\n            </p>\n          </FontColor>\n        </Animator>\n        <Animator containerType={ContainerType.ImageSquare}>\n          <picture>\n            <source\n              srcSet={require(`../../public/images/work/eraise/designs.png?webp`)}\n              type=\"image/webp\"\n            />\n            <img src={require(`../../public/images/work/eraise/designs.png`)} />\n          </picture>\n        </Animator>\n      </DoubleColumn>\n\n      <SkillsBanner skills={work.skills} />\n\n      <DoubleColumn>\n        <Animator containerType={ContainerType.ContentSquare} backgroundColor={work.color}>\n          <ElementSpacing>\n            <h2>Code</h2>\n          </ElementSpacing>\n          <p>\n            As fun as designing Eraise was, my favorite moments came while building the app. I\n            enjoyed architecting a stack using some of the most exciting technologies in software\n            development. From Next.js to TS Node - PostgreSQL to Objection.js - Heroku and Firebase\n            and Stripe and so many more awesome technologies. I had a blast. I wrote some crazy sql\n            queries, created a cool logging and notification system using Stripe's API, and worked\n            with GitHub's new project management tools to manage it all. I learned so much while\n            building Eraise and that's exactly why I wanted to build it.\n          </p>\n        </Animator>\n        <Animator containerType={ContainerType.ImageSquare}>\n          <picture>\n            <source\n              srcSet={require(`../../public/images/work/eraise/code.png?webp`)}\n              type=\"image/webp\"\n            />\n            <img src={require(`../../public/images/work/eraise/code.png`)} />\n          </picture>\n        </Animator>\n      </DoubleColumn>\n\n      <DoubleColumn reverse={true}>\n        <Animator containerType={ContainerType.ContentSquare} backgroundColor={Color.silver}>\n          <FontColor color={Color.darkGray}>\n            <ElementSpacing>\n              <h2>Infrastructure</h2>\n            </ElementSpacing>\n            <p>\n              While Eraise is a small app with a small scope, it required a complex infrastructure.\n              One of the big concerns was security. I researched and used the most secure\n              technologies for the given problems. Google's Firebase was used for authentication.\n              Stripe was used for payments. Stripe's Plaid was used for authenticating with the\n              banks and returning loan information. GitHub was used for the code repository and\n              Heroku for hosting. Overall I love the infrastructure that I came up with for Eraise.\n            </p>\n          </FontColor>\n        </Animator>\n        <Animator containerType={ContainerType.ImageSquare}>\n          <picture>\n            <source\n              srcSet={require(`../../public/images/work/eraise/infrastructure.png?webp`)}\n              type=\"image/webp\"\n            />\n            <img src={require(`../../public/images/work/eraise/infrastructure.png`)} />\n          </picture>\n        </Animator>\n      </DoubleColumn>\n\n      <div style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }}>\n        <ReactPlayer\n          url=\"/images/work/eraise/video.mp4\"\n          width=\"100%\"\n          height=\"100%\"\n          style={{ display: 'flex' }}\n          loop={true}\n          playing={false}\n          controls={true}\n        />\n      </div>\n\n      <Animator containerType={ContainerType.CenterBanner} backgroundColor={Color.darkGray}>\n        <ElementSpacing>\n          <TextCenter>\n            <h2>Results</h2>\n          </TextCenter>\n        </ElementSpacing>\n        <p>\n          In six months I finished the app and all the supporting tasks. I started by designing the\n          brand, wireframing, and then designing in parallel with coding the app. I rolled a\n          powerful stack that was a lot of fun to work with. The stack included Next.js with Emotion\n          and Redux for the frontend, and Typescript Node using Express and Objection.js along with\n          postgreSQL for the backend. While architecting the infrastructure I utilized a number of\n          useful resources to solve specific problems including Stripe, Plaid, Firebase\n          Authentication, and Heroku to name a few.\n        </p>\n      </Animator>\n\n      <DoubleColumn>\n        <AllProjects />\n        <NextProject work={nextWork} />\n      </DoubleColumn>\n\n      <Footer />\n      <ContactSection />\n    </>\n  );\n};\n"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AAEA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAUA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AACA;AAFA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAQA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AASA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AACA;AAFA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAKA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAUA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AACA;AAFA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAKA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAOA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AACA;AAFA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAKA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAWA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AACA;AAFA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAKA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAUA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AACA;AAFA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAKA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAUA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AACA;AAFA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAKA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAPA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAWA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAWA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
