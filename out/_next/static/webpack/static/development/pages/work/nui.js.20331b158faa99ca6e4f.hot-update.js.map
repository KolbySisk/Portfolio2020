The infrastructure needed for\n            NUI were not developed. My first tasks was to develop these systems. I created systems\n            for documenting team knowledge, team processes, project information. I engineered a\n            CI/CD process that helped to automate various DevOps processes while developing. I\n            architected a governance system for scaling and growing NUI.\n          </p>\n        </Animator>\n        <Animator containerType={ContainerType.ImageSquare}>\n          <picture>\n            <source\n              srcSet={require(`../../public/images/work/nui/systems.png?webp`)}\n              type=\"image/webp\"\n            />\n            <img src={require(`../../public/images/work/nui/systems.png`)} />\n          </picture>\n        </Animator>\n      </DoubleColumn>\n      <SkillsBanner skills={work.skills} />\n      <DoubleColumn reverse={true}>\n        <Animator containerType={ContainerType.ContentSquare} backgroundColor={Color.silver}>\n          <FontColor color={Color.darkGray}>\n            <ElementSpacing>\n              <h2>Component Libraries</h2>\n            </ElementSpacing>\n            <p>\n              With the supporting infrastructure in place I started the next large effort - building\n              my first component library. The goal was to make a library containing Angular\n              components that could easily be used throughout NCR. The scope was large, but I\n              enjoyed the process and learn a ton. I started by digging through Google’s Angular\n              Material code, then I dug through Angular’s code. I learned Angular inside and out\n              along with the best practices for creating Angular component libraries. Then I\n              architected and built the component library. I implemented accessibility solutions,\n              optimizations, unit tests, technical documentation and much more.\n            </p>\n          </FontColor>\n        </Animator>\n        <Animator containerType={ContainerType.ImageSquare}>\n          <picture>\n            <source\n              srcSet={require(`../../public/images/work/nui/components.png?webp`)}\n              type=\"image/webp\"\n            />\n            <img src={require(`../../public/images/work/nui/components.png`)} />\n          </picture>\n        </Animator>\n      </DoubleColumn>\n      <DoubleColumn>\n        <Animator containerType={ContainerType.ContentSquare} backgroundColor={work.color}>\n          <ElementSpacing>\n            <h2>Mentoring & teaching </h2>\n          </ElementSpacing>\n          <p>\n            When I wasn’t working directly on NUI I was mentoring people throughout the NCR. I\n            worked with developers and designers and provided guidance, advice, and constructive\n            criticism. While doing so I learned that teaching is a great tool for learning.\n          </p>\n        </Animator>\n        <Animator containerType={ContainerType.ImageSquare}>\n          <picture>\n            <source\n              srcSet={require(`../../public/images/work/nui/teaching.png?webp`)}\n              type=\"image/webp\"\n            />\n            <img src={require(`../../public/images/work/nui/teaching.png`)} />\n          </picture>\n        </Animator>\n      </DoubleColumn>\n      <Animator containerType={ContainerType.CenterBanner} backgroundColor={Color.darkGray}>\n        <ElementSpacing>\n          <TextCenter>\n            <h2>Results</h2>\n          </TextCenter>\n        </ElementSpacing>\n        <p>\n          During my time at NCR I was able to accomplish and learn so much more than I dreamed\n          possible. My team and I were able to build the design system NCR needed. The impact NUI\n          had at NCR is huge. Not only were we able to provide value to designers and developers\n          with NUI, but we also cultivated an environment that encourages sharing and learning.\n        </p>\n      </Animator>\n      <DoubleColumn>\n        <AllProjects />\n        <NextProject work={nextWork} />\n      </DoubleColumn>\n      <Footer />\n\n      <ContactSection />\n    </>\n  );\n};\n"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AAEA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAQA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AACA;AAFA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAKA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AASA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAQA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AACA;AAFA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAQA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AACA;AAFA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAQA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AACA;AAFA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAYA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AACA;AAFA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AACA;AAFA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAOA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
